# About-Me
About Me I'm Vasista. I am a high school student looking to graduate high school with a 4.3+ GPA. My goals are getting into MIT, becoming an aerospace engineer, and getting a high paying job. I'm currently learning Python with some experience. I also have experience in QBASIC and HTML. I intend to start learning Java.
